# Project 1 Grading and Submission

Total Points: 200

## Grading Policy

- Each question is graded on a **0–100% scale**:
  - **100%** if your answer is correct or reanable.  
  - **0%** if your answer is missing or entirely incorrect.  
  - **0%** if your answer is too low in quality.
  - **Partial credit** may be awarded for incomplete but reasonable answers.

---

## Submission Requirements

- You will create **Marp slides** to present your tutorial to your (future) team members.  
Your slides will also become part of your **portfolio**, shared on **GitHub & GitHub.io**.
- The slides should clearly explain how to use your REST APIs with enough detail for beginners.

---

### Guidelines

- **Use the provided Marp slide templates** in the `marp` directory.
- For each question:
  - Create a tutorial-style slide with **examples and explanations** (similar to my marp slides).  
  - Add **pictures or diagrams** if they help understanding.  
- You may refer to my slides in `module1/lecture`:
  - If you do, include a **comment** in your Marp file noting the reference  
    (e.g., file name and page number) to avoid plagiarism.  
- You may also **reuse your homework answers**, but cite them properly if necessary.
